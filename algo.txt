# ### 1. Understanding Algorithms and Problem-Solving

# An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure to solve a specific problem. Think of it like a recipe with instructions. In programming, an algorithm will process input data, carry out operations, and return output. Here’s a simple example:

# - **Problem**: Find the maximum number in a list of numbers.
# - **Algorithm (steps)**:
#     - Step 1: Start with the first number in the list as the maximum.
#     - Step 2: Go through each number in the list.
#     - Step 3: If a number is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum.
#     - Step 4: After checking all numbers, the maximum holds the highest value.

# ### 2. Algorithm Design Basics

# When designing algorithms, it helps to:
# - **Break down the problem** into manageable parts.
# - **Plan your steps** to achieve the solution.
# - **Iterate** over steps to optimize them.

# ### 3. Basic Algorithms and Examples in Python

# Let's start by implementing a few basic algorithms in Python to get familiar with coding structures and logic.

# #### Example 1: Find the Maximum in a List

# Here’s how you might implement the algorithm to find the maximum number in a list.

# ```python
# def find_maximum(numbers):
#     max_num = numbers[0]  # Start with the first element
#     for num in numbers:   # Loop through each number in the list
#         if num > max_num:
#             max_num = num
#     return max_num
# ```

# **Usage**:
# ```python
# print(find_maximum([3, 5, 9, 2, 8]))  # Output should be 9
# ```

# #### Example 2: Factorial of a Number (using recursion)

# The factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \). 

# **Algorithm**:
# 1. If \( n \) is 0 or 1, return 1.
# 2. Otherwise, return \( n \times \text{factorial}(n-1) \).

# **Python Code**:

# ```python
# def factorial(n):
#     if n == 0 or n == 1:
#         return 1
#     else:
#         return n * factorial(n - 1)
# ```

# **Usage**:
# ```python
# print(factorial(5))  # Output should be 120
# ```

# ### 4. Complexity Analysis (Big O Notation)

# As we create algorithms, we want to understand their **efficiency**. This is done using **Big O Notation**, which tells us how the algorithm’s running time grows as the input size increases. For example:
# - \( O(1) \): Constant time — independent of input size.
# - \( O(n) \): Linear time — grows proportionally with the input size.
# - \( O(n^2) \): Quadratic time — grows with the square of the input size.

# For the examples above:
# - `find_maximum` has \( O(n) \) complexity because it iterates through the list once.
# - `factorial` has \( O(n) \) complexity but uses **recursion**, which can affect performance.

# ### 5. Common Data Structures and Algorithms

# Next, we’ll look at more complex algorithms, which often require specific data structures like:
# - **Arrays and Lists** (for storing ordered data)
# - **Dictionaries/Hash Maps** (for fast lookup)
# - **Stacks and Queues** (for processing items in a particular order)
# - **Trees** and **Graphs** (for hierarchical or interconnected data)

# Each structure comes with its own algorithms that optimize certain types of problems.

# ### 6. Practical Problem-Solving

# To become proficient, practice is essential. Try coding exercises on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal. Focus on problems related to searching, sorting, string manipulation, and dynamic programming to build foundational skills.
